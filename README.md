- 1-concat - a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string

- 2-floor - a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.
- 3-to_str -a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

- 4-define_variables - Defining and annotating variables
- 5-sum_list - a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

- 6-sum_mixed_list - a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
